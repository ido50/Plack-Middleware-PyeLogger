Revision history for Plack-Middleware-PyeLogger

{{$NEXT}}
	- Bugfix: the test had a wrong value for a skip check, causing it
	  to fail when MongoDB was not installed. Also, it was still dependent
	  on the MongoDB backend, which is wrong, so the test is now removed
	  completely until a suitable replacement is created.
