NAME
    Plack::Middleware::PyeLogger - Use Pye as a Plack logger

SYNOPSIS
            builder {
                    enable 'PyeLogger', opts => \%opts;
                    $app;
            };

DESCRIPTION
    This Plack middleware sets Pye as a logger for your Plack applications
    ("psgix.logger"). It differs from "normal" Plack loggers in that the
    "psgix.logger" subroutine takes a hash-ref of a different format:

    *   message - the text of the message (this is standard to all loggers)

    *   session_id - the ID of the session (this is required for this
        logger)

    *   data - an optional hash-ref of data to attach to the message

    Also, the "level" key is ignored, as "Pye" has no log levels.

METHODS
    This module implements the following methods, as required by
    Plack::Middleware/Plack::Component.

  prepare_app()
    Generates an instance of Pye.

  call( \%env )
    Creates the "psgix.logger" subroutine for your app.

CONFIGURATION
    You can pass any options Pye accepts in its "new()" constructor as a
    hash-ref, under the opts key. For example:

            builder {
                    enable 'PyeLogger', opts => { log_coll => 'logsssss!!!!!!' };
                    $app;
            };
